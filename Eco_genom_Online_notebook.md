# Project title    

### Author: Muhammad kala     
### Ecological Genomics:   

## Overall Description of notebook      

Notebook for the Ecological Genomics Class. I still prefer my physical notebook :(


## Date started: (2017-01-18)   
## Date end:   (2017-month-day)    

## Philosophy   
Science should be reproducible and one of the best ways to achieve this is by logging research activities in a notebook. Because science/biology has increasingly become computational, it is easier to document computational projects in an electronic form, which can be shared online through Github.    

### Helpful features of the notebook     

**It is absolutely critical for your future self and others to follow your work.**     

* The notebook is set up with a series of internal links from the table of contents.    
* All notebooks should have a table of contents which has the "Entry", date, and title (information that allows the reader to understand your work).     
* Also, one of the perks of keeping all activities in a single document is that you can **search and find elements quickly**.     
* You can document anything you'd like, aside from logging your research activities. For example:
	* feel free to log all/any ideas for your research project([example](https://github.com/adnguyen/Notebooks_and_Protocols/blob/master/2016_notebook.md#Entry-39-2016-06-13-post-doc-project-idea-assessing-current-impacts-of-climate-change-in-natural-populations)) as an entry,     
	* or write down notes for a paper([example](https://github.com/adnguyen/Notebooks_and_Protocols/blob/master/2016_notebook.md#id-section36).      

* Lastly, you can share specific entries because of the three "#" automatically creates a link when the notebook renders on github.

### Melissa background	  

**Background, what drove Melissa and Steve to ecological genomics?**       

Melissa read a cool paper that scales from analyzing a few loci to the whole genome.   

One figure popped out at her, FST (developed by Sewell Wright) histogram.   FST of 1= complete differentiation, FST of 0 = no diff. FST described as **Alleles in space**. From this histogram, Melissa was struck by how you can separate out neutral from selective ones.  

Melissa has a data set with 96 sea stars and then the 16s microbiome. Would be cool to see if there is heritability in some bactera

### Steve background   

* Inspired by Yanis Antonivics (an **OG**)   
* At the time, just so stories: **Adaptatationist programme**    
	* Just go out and go by feeling in a natural history way and prescribe an adaptation story   
	* Janis wrote a creed to quantify the operational relationship between traits, environment, and genetics     
* Yanis was on Steve's committee and Steve was interested in adaptation with respect to invasion biology because organisms need to respond to novel environments     
	* Phenotypes can relate to the environment, but what is the genetic basis of local adaptation (in situ)? There are other confounding issues: demographic effects, plasticity     
* Steve thinks about environment-phenotype-genetics triangle. Basically a path diagram that feeds back on each other.    
	* Relationship between genes and phenotype ---GWAS (Genome wide association study)    
	* Relationship between genetics and environment --- Fst, clines between allele frequencies and environment    
* Invasion history is tough because of demographic history    
* He decided to focus on trees; large population size, straddle huge environmental gradients so the opportunity for selection is high   
	* positive relationship between Growing season length and traits    
	* Did a  reciprocal transplant of different populations to identify the extent of local adaptation in large established common gardens    
	* SK does GBS (genotype by sequencing)      
	* Problem with field: validating key gene candidates

### Entry 2: 2017-01-23

## Rubric for Info Update:
* Outline   
* ~20 min   
* Learning/engaging activity   
* Use board efficiently   
* Take-home messages   
* Examples from literature   

### Melissa's Info Update: Next Generation Sequencing

## 1. Advances in Technology  
Huge advances made in technology in the last decade (still moving quite fast)

Contrast between Human Genome Project and current technology

Human Genome Project:
* done 2001-2003   
* ABI-Sanger Sequencing   
* 15 years   
* 1 genome   
* $3 billion   

HiSeq XTen (Illumina):
* 2014   
* 1 day   
* 45 whole human genomes   
* S1000 each   

## 2. Range of Applications
* WGS (Whole Genome Sequencing)   
* RNA-seq   
* ChIP-seq (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing)   
* Targetted/Capture sequencing   

## 3. General Library Prep. Workflow   

#### Techniques depends on applications/goals

where is genetic variation?   

number of samples:
* population   
* individual   
* comparative studies   
* model organism or not (model organisms have reference genomes/transcriptomes etc)   

demographic history

adaptive genentic variation

gene expression variation

#### Decisions based on what is needed:

* Length of reads   
* Number of reads   
* Distribution of reads   

Reduced rep.:
* RNA (coding)-more reads for highly expressed regions   
* GBS/RAD (near restriction sites)    

Extraction (DNA or RNA->cDNA), fragment sample, ligate adaptors (individual barcodes), add sequence adaptors, PCR    

## 4. Sequence by Synthesis (SBS)

Adapters are added to our DNA segments. DNA goes into a lane of flow cell. Adapters bind to oligo's and our DNA forms a bridge. A picture is taken every time a complementary labeled dNTP's is added.   

90% of global data by Illumina     

Combining different methods help in assembling genomes of non-model organisms (de novo assembly)     

## Glossary 
```
short reads 50 bp   
long reads 100 bp, 150 bp, 300 bp    
longer reads 10000-60000 bp (SMRT)- faster but not as accurate, so not good for de novo assembly   
```

### Entry 3: 2017-01-25

## Info Update: QTN

## 1. What are QTN's?
Quantitative Trait Nucleotides
E.g. of Quantitative Traits   
-Flowering time (phenology)-continuous trait        
-Flower color-discrete trait       
-Thermal tolerance       
-Venom potency   
-Defense compounds   
-Toxin tolerance   
-Drought tolerance        
-Altitude (hypoxia) tolerance   

## 2. Quantitative genetic theory of adaptive traits   
V~A~ (additive genetic variance)   
h^2^ (heritability)   

Reminder h^2^=V~A~/V~P~, where V~P~ is phenotypic variance                 
Since mutation can diminish or augment avg fitness, big change mutations tend to be extreme and not selected. More info with figures in notebook

## 3. Methods
-Linkage mapping      
-Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)     
-Selection Scans

### Entry 4: 2017-01-30

## Project Info

## Sea Stars Wasting Disease

- Widespread   
- Many species affected (resistance vary among species)   
- Starts with loss of turgor pressure and/or lesions (holes)     
- Progress into limbs being pulled off (when sea stars move or through gravity)      
- *Pisaster* *ochraceus* (Alaska to Baja, CA). Orange or purple     
- First reports of disease in 2012 (Isolated cases from 1970)     
- Densovirus implicated     
- Present in 70 yo museum specimens      
- Outbreaks in 1970's, 1980's but not as extreme as current outbreak     
- All individuals exposed     
- Disease seem to be more prevalent intertidally (warmer temperatures, more variable environment)   
- Epidermal (host biopsy). Extracted RNA, got all mRNA (poly A-tail) using 5 Illumina hi-Seq 3000PE100 lanes to get gene expression data.   
- 16S rRNA amplified     
- Starfish collected and delivered within 24 hours of collection (all healthy at time)     
- Transmission might be environmental or through the gut     


## Update
Densovirus seem to be missing from samples

## Project ideas for each group in notebook and on [Andrew's github](https://github.com/adnguyen/Notebooks_and_Protocols/blob/master/2017_Eco_Gen_ANBE_nb.md#id-section4) 

Kirsten and I have chosen to look at SNPs to see if allelic differences might be accounting for resistance to disease, and maybe look at microbiome as well.

### Entry 5: 2017-02-01

## Info update: WGS    

### 1. Applications:    
-Population genetics: effective population size, demographic events (admixture), genetic relatedness, inbreeding    
-Conservation (genomics): monitoring, breeding programs    
-Taxonomic delineations    

Benefits 
* Higher power + resolution   
* New possible research areas: screening for variation, adaptive potential of population e.g.    
-QTL/Association mapping     
-pinpoint loci of adaptations      
-impact of genetic variation    
-patterns of gene expression    
-plastic response to environmental changes    
-use of ancient material    
-environmental samples 

### 2. Planning stage

Basic considerations 
- Is sequence necessary for purpose?    
- Do we have the resources for quality genome production?     
low quality = low coverage of whole genome    

Limitations (Usually one individual sequenced):
- Polymorphic genes    
- Paralogs    
- Rapidly evolving genes     
- Large gene families     
- Not type specimens (Use of pooled samples can help fix this)    
- Impossible to sequence all nucleotides (centromeres an telomeres; highly repetitive regions)     
- Error     
- Working hypothesis: assembly tools     

Prior Considerations     
- seq platform:     
-Short: Illumina Hi-seq (150bp) and SOLID (50bp)       
-Longer: Pacific Biosciences (5Kb), Ion torrent (~500bp), Illumina Molecule (up to 10KB)     
-Hybrids (studies typically use more than one i.e. both short and long reads for scaffolding)      

- Knowledge on organism     
-Genome size     
-Seq error rates    
-Repeat content     
-Degree of genome duplications     
Recommended pilot short-insert seq      
 
### 3. Methods

Wet lab procedures    
* Individual     
-Heterozygous position have adverse effects on assembly     
-Highly polypoid are challenging (special pipelines); use of inbred individuals, parthenogenic or genocentric offspring         
-Have metadata, age, sex, location   

* Tissue     
-Avoid energetically active tissue such as muslce (increase in mitochondrial DNA because increase in read depth)   
-Avoid gut+skin (non target DNA)        

* DNA      
-High quality, non degradable     
-Check with high resolution gel      

* Library Preparation     
I. Use single reads/remove duplicated reads    
II. Insert sizes within 0.2-40 kb range (>20 kb for scaffold)    
III. Read orientation:    
-Inwards (paired-end)      
-Outwards (outward)       
Mis orientation can happen/ could be chimeric segment from non adjascent DNA     

### 4. Genome assembly  

Storage     
Server     
Expertise    

Pipeline applicable to non models    

* Pre Assembly    
-Quality    
-GC content    
-Repeat abundance    
-Proportion of duplicate read     
-Seq for calibration must be removed (Illumina)    

* De novo     
  
-Algorithms (minimize misassembly and improve contiguity)    
-OLC (Overlap-Layout-Consensus)    
-Extension-based     
-Hybrid approaches    

## Info update: RNA-seq   

### 1. Advantages:
- Differential gene expression: in tissues there is variation    
- Allele specific expression: environmental response of adaptation       
- Functional relevant subset of the genome       


RNA seq better than microarray in wide range expression, info on splicing events     

### 2. Limitations

- Does not give abundance of protein or other post-translational modification of proteins (and function)    

### 3. Workflow

Exp setup -> Tissue prep + library -> High throughput seq -> Transcriptome reconstruction -> Alignment of reads -> Read Qualification/Marker development -> Biological Influence     

- Setup   
-Coding or regulatory      
-Is there a reference genome?     
-Alternative splicing?     
-Technology?     
-Population or specific treatments     

- Tissue prep     
Small organisms-many tissues pulled    
-Sample should be in RNase free environment    
-DNase treatment    
-get rid of rRNAs      
Figures in physical textbook.      

- Library    
-Single end     
-Paired end      

- High throughput seq     
Choose platform:      
-Pyrosequencing by Roche (some incorrect polymer)     
-Ion torrent      
-GA/Hi-seq Illumina     

- Reconstruction    
Figures in physical textbook.      

## Info Update: Amplicon seq     

Targetted approach for analyzing genetic variation in specific genomic region      

Amplicon is a targeted gene (region) to be amplified via PCR w/ specific primers      

- Library Prep     

Extract -> 1st PCR (amplify gene w/ primers) -> gel -> 2nd PCR w/ barcodes and adaptors (or directly to Seq. Facility) -> clean -> pool -> Seq facility     

454 replaced by Mi-Seq platform from Illumina  

Trim adaptors      
Align    

- Limitation   
Time consuming to manually correct some sequencing mistakes    
 
- Advantages    
Save time and money     

## Info Update: GBS RAD-seq

GBS: Genotyping by sequencing     
RAD: Restriction assisted DNA sequencing (using restriction enzymes)     

GBS RAD-seq is between RNA-seq and Amplicon in terms of completeness of data and sampling     

-lot of individuals     
-lots of SNPs across genomes     
-don't care about specific genes     
Useful for population genetics (population genetic diversity of one species)     

- Library Prep    

Restriction enzymes -> Barcodes + Adaptors -> PCR -> sequence    

More info and drawings in notebook.      


## Coding

Doing a de novo assembly on Trinity 

First, we will be cleaning files using Trimmomatic PE

Logging in to terminal (through PuTTY)

server pbio381.uvm.edu
Use UVM login and password as login and password

"top" command that tells us who is using cpus in the server

"q" quit

"ll" List all files in the current directory

"mkdir abc" makes a directory (folder) called "abc" where you are

"~" home directory (we all have one)

"cd" makes you change directory (so cd ~ makes you go to home directory)

"pw" tells us where we are (path from home directory)

"rm" remove file

"mv" move files

## Dunning et al. 2014 Paper discussion    

Unigene-alternative splice variant contigs are collapsed into "unigenes" (typically the longest)        
Picture in notebook   

Gene Ontology- Functional categories a gene is in (e.g. immune response gene)        

3. B Annotation   
Blast X to  
-nr (gene annotation)     
-uniprot database (curated protein database)    
-gene ontology   

Fisher's exact test (chi squared test)    
e.g. if 60K unigenes    
~10% of them are involved in cuticular hydrocarbon    

2k differentially expressed genes    
~20% of them are invovled in cuticular hydrocarbon (higher than predicted)     

Q plot -> y-axis ancestry, x-axis individuals of species. colors represent portion of where genome of individuals come from.       

K-number of groups- cross validation support 3 groups best (lowest cross validation error)   

Table2    
CS- increased expression in cold shock      
CS- increased expression in control     
DRR- Number of differentially expressed genes      
 
## Coding

De novo assembly on Trinity    

Go on server through PuTTY    

Cleaning on Trimmomatic PE   

We will evaluate, clean and evaluate some fastq files each.


Mine are 
09_5-14_S_2_R1.fq.gz
09_5-14_S_2_R2.fq.gz

09 is the individual number
5-14  is the date
S is sick (H would be a healthy individual)
2 (rating of sickness on a 0-5 scale, 0 being healthy, and 5 being dead)
"cp" command for copy ("cp XYZ ~/mydata/" means copy file XYZ into the mydata that is in home directory)

Use zcat to look at zipped file

zcat FILENAME | head

"head" gives us the first few lines (10?) instead of showing the whole file

Lines
open line with "J00160...." are the sequencing details (adaptors...etc)
sequence
letters giving the quality of the sequence above
quality score


Rest of info (about phred score...etc) on [Tutorial](https://adnguyen.github.io/2017_Ecological_Genomics/Tutorial/2017-02-06_RNAseq_tutorial.html)

### Entry 7: 02-08-2017    

## Info Update: Transcriptomics    

- Intro    
Why study wild systems?     
-Non model/non traditional model organisms      
-Silent genes responding to multiple stimuli      
-Novel transcripts w/o homologs in closely related model organisms     

- Methods    
Micro Array: easy for ecological analyses    
RNA-Seq: Genome-wide, more involved analyses     

- Questions   
-Questions about variation in gene expression          
-How gene expression affect phenotypes      
-Effect of environmental stimuli on gene expression      
Only 5 papers looked at all three (Venn Diagram in notebook about number of studies looking at each question)         

1. Gene expression variation at species, population, individual levels. Variation at different time or life history stages.      

Evolutionary Process    
 
-Gene expression heritable (naturally selected)       
-Epigenetics      
-Qst & Fst comparison     
-eQTL- expression quatitative trait loci mapping     
-Macroevolution: drift, bottleneck, selection    

2. Environmental stimuli on gene expression     
-abiotic stress    
-environmental heterogeneity    
-host-parasite interactions    
-selective biotic & abiotic interactions       
-flash freezing (to avoid stimuli) takes a snapshot of the moment     
-time course analysis- transcriptional response through time     

3. How gene expression affect phenotype     
-alternate phenotypes       
-manipulating transcription to make inferences about genotype-phenotype relationships -> transgenics (moving from correlation to causation): RNAi, CRISPR    

- Future      
-Combined micro arrays and RNA-seq (mostly used for model organisms)       
-Expand on databse for proposed ecological variations

### Entry 8: 2017-02-13

## Info Update: RNA-seq 3

- Background
-Enables DE examination (inter-population individual)    
Disease Resistance
Mating Behavior
Adaptive significance

-Molecular Mechanisms -> Phenotypic/behavioral plasticity, migration patterns

-Limitations
Reference genome quality
Gene annotation availability
Expense per sample lib. prep.

- Issues
-Under utilization of biological replicates
Requiring independent library preparations
Doesn't include pooled samples
23/158 studies (15%) > 3 Bio replicates
Derive broad biological conclusions

-Prioritize seq depth over replication 

-Wide dynamic range of RNA-seq data noisy (Poisson counting error, technical variance, biological variance)

```
Glossary
- sequence coverage: the average # of reads that align/cover known reference bases
- read depth: total # bases sequenced/aligned at given reference base position
- power: probability of rejecting false null hypothesis
```

- General rules of thumb
1. Use more biological replicates instead of depth
2. Sequence depth >10 reads per transcript. ~10-20 million mapped reads/samples
3. 3 biological replicates per condition
4. Conduct a pilot experiment to know:
i) What is best/most powerful experiment that can be afforded
ii) what is the smallest fold change that can be detected


## Coding:

grep command and tutorial script used to know whether a read maps to a single place on the transcriptome or several. Important for gene expression studies since expression of a gene is based on the number of read counts. 

[Tutorial](https://adnguyen.github.io/2017_Ecological_Genomics/Tutorial/2017-02-15_RNAseq_Map_Count.html)

vcf tools filtering strategy from last time       
```
$ vcftools --gzvcf SSW_byind.txt.vcf.gz --min-alleles 2 --max-alleles 2 --maf 0.02 --max-missing 0.8 --recode --out ~/SSW_all_biallelic.MAF0.02.Miss0.8    

$ gzip SSW_all_biallelic.MAF0.02.Miss0.8.recode.vcf      

$ vcftools --gzvcf SSW_all_biallelic.MAF0.02.Miss0.8.recode.vcf --hardy       
```

min-alleles 2 represents minimum number of alleles at each SNP set at 2     
max-alleles 2 represents the maximum number of alleles for each SNP set at 2(typically not common to get more than 2)     
maf 0.02 means that alleles with less than 2% frequency were ignored     
max-missing 0.8- include only sites that were present in 80% in samples
